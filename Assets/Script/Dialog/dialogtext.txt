Nightingale: Can you hear people cheering out side? They’re saying:”Comet, Comet!”
Girl: “Comet?” I’ve only heard of it through books. It said it’s the most beautiful star in the world...
Nightingale: Can you see it through the window? What does a “comet” look like?
Girl: The sky was blocked by trees. I could only see a few light. 
Girl: It’s okay! I’ve heard about it in books, let me draw it for you!
